# Mars wiki

This file is just a greeting file to access the library head over [here](https://github.com/mars-college/alexandria/wiki).

To be able to edit content in the library you have to have a github.com account and be a member of this repository. Just ping someone asking to be included.

The wiki uses markdown language, a simple language created to make text editing easy. You will recognize lots of the modifiers on this language are all around the web, like on whatsapp, or facebook. Here's a quick cheatsheet:
